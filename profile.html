        <h1>I am M. Vijaynath</h1>
        <p>
            You can call me VJ !
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a passionate and accomplished Embedded Software Engineer with over 17 years of experience working across the automotive, aerospace, and military domains. Currently, I serve as a Principle Software Engineer at Valeo, where I lead advanced projects focused on radar-camera fusion, domain-controlled embedded systems, and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve always had a strong drive to “make things work.” Whether it's optimizing complex algorithms for EyeQ DSPs or architecting mission-critical systems, I enjoy turning challenging ideas into practical, high-impact embedded solutions. I’ve led cross-functional teams of up to 12 engineers, and I take pride in not just proposing innovations—but making sure they're built and delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem-solving excites me. I love building from scratch, creating rapid prototypes, and debugging hardware-software integration challenges. Throughout my journey—from Data Patterns and Honeywell Aerospace to Aptiv and Valeo—I’ve contributed to systems for unmanned vehicles, aircraft engines, and next-gen automotive platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a certified requirement engineer and an award-winning trainer, I’m also passionate about mentoring and knowledge sharing. My personal mission is simple: to bring innovation alive through hands-on development, deep collaboration, and endless curiosity.
